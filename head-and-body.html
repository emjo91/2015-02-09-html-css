    <h3>Head</h3>
    <p>The head of the HTML document is where things that you don't want to be displayed go. Links to your css style sheet can go here, as well as an embedded style sheet if you want it to go there. A title to your page can go here as well.</p>
  
    <h3>Body</h3>
    <p>The body is where you want your content to be displayed. The framework, of how the page is set up also goes here. You can view the content, images, click on links, and do just about anything else here.</p>
